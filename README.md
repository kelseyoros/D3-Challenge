# D3-Challenge

This project exposes health risks facing particular demographics. The data that is used in the visualizations and analyses comes from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  You can take a look at the dataset here: [Census Data](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml).
