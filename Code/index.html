          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>First, let's take a look at the health risks for people in poverty.  For states that have high percentages of
            poverty, they also have increased amounts of people who lack healthcare.  This can be explained by healthcare
            being attached to your employment.  This same positive correlation is demonstrated when looking at poverty and
            obesity.  It is typical for impoverished places to be categorized as food deserts, therefore making it increasingly
            difficult to access quality ingredients and meals.  There seems to be little correlation between poverty and smoking,
            suggesting that every socio-economic group has some percentage of people smoking.
          </p>

          <p>Switching over to correlations between health risks and age, we will first dissect healthcare and age.  There is a 
            seemingly negative correlation between age and lacking healthcare.  In other words, the younger population is typically
            the group that lacks healthcare while the older population has attained it.  This could be due to senior citizens
            being offered healthcare through the government.  Obesity and age have no correlation, but most states are reporting
            a similar percentage of obesity.  For smoking, the older the population is the more smokers the state has.  Education
            regarding smoking has changed drastically over the years and the dangers of smoking are now being taught to people from
            a very young age.  This could explain why the older populations who did not necessarily recieve the same warnings are
            more likely to smoke.
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, we can compare the health risks to the median household income.  The higher the median income, the more likely
            it is to have healthcare.  This is similar to what we saw with poverty and again could be explained by healthcare being
            offered through employment.  The same trend follows for income vs. obesity and smoking as well.  The higher the income,
            the less likely you are to be obese or smoke.
